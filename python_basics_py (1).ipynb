        "1.what is python, and why is it popular?\n",
        ">- python is a high level,interpreted programming language that is widely used for building software application ,websites,data analysis,machine learning,automationand much more\n",
        "\n",
        ">-why pyhton is popular\n",
        "  -simple and easy to learn\n",

        "  >-an interpreter is a program that executes python code line by line\n",
        "  when you write python code (.py file),the interpreter translate it into machine readable instructions so  the computer can run it.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3.what are predefined key words in python?\n",

        "  6.why are lists mutables, but tuple are immutable?\n",
        "   >-list in python are mutable because they are designed to be dynamic and flexible  data structures.\n",
